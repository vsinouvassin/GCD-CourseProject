## CodeBook for run_analysis.R

# Experimental design (description taken from the original README.txt)
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. 
Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz have been captured.
The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

# Raw data
The raw data can be classified as following :

1. X_train.txt and X_test.txt contain all the measurements when considered together:
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.

features.txt contains the description for these measurements:
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.

2. subject_train.txt and subject_test.txt: Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.

3. y_train.txt and y_test.txt contain the activities executed by the subject for each observation. It is a numeric value from 1 to .

The definition of these numbers is contained in activity_labels.txt.
This file links the class labels with their activity name:
WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING

# Processed data
1. For processing the data, I've not considered the "pure raw" data contained inside in the "Inertial signals" folders for both train and test data.
These data have already been pre-processed for obtaining the measurements in X_train.txt and X_test.txt files as described in the original README.txt.

## 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Merging of data
Following the description of the raw data above, I've merged the following files together:
- X_train.txt and X_test.txt: Added the rows from X_test.txt to the rows of X_train.txt for getting the whole measurements data (called xData)
- subject_train.txt and subject_test.txt: Added the rows from subject_train.txt to the rows of subject_test.txt for getting the whole subject data (called subjectData)
- y_train.txt and y_test.txt: Added the rows from y_train.txt to the rows of y_test.txt for getting the whole activity data (called activityData)

Then I've named each data :
- I've used the variable names contained in features.txt for the measurements data
- I've named the subject data "subject"
- I've named the activity data "activity"

For finishing, I've merged these 3 data sets together by adding the subject column and the activity column (in this order) to the right of the measurements data.
It produces the mainData data frame.

## 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. For extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement, I've checked the presence in the variable names of the "feature" part (coming from the features.txt file) of the following strings:
- "mean()" for the mean value
- "std()" for the standard deviation value
The parentheses are important here or else, for instance, if we search for only "mean", we can find "meanFreq" values which are the weighted average of the frequency components (this gives a mean frequency).

And then I've filtered the mainData on the columns containing the means, the standard deviations, the subject and the activity values.

## 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. As described previously, the activity names were stored as a Factor of 6 levels in the raw data contained in "activity_labels.txt" file:
WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING

Then I've made the following changes to these names:
- put all the labels to lower case
- delete the underscore in walking_upstairs and walking_downstairs and capitalized the first letter of the second word for each of these labels
- capitalize the first letter of each label

I get the following labels stored as characters:
Walking, WalkingUpstairs, WalkingDownstairs, Sitting, Standing, Laying

Finally, for this step, I replace the numeric values of the column "activity" of the mainData by their respective labels given in the reshaped activity labels data.

## 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. The filtered variables names from the step 2 of the course project are the following:
[1] "tBodyAcc-mean()-X"            "tBodyAcc-mean()-Y"          
[3] "tBodyAcc-mean()-Z"            "tBodyAcc-std()-X"

[27] "tBodyGyroJerk-mean()-Z"      "tBodyGyroJerk-std()-X"      
[29] "tBodyGyroJerk-std()-Y"       "tBodyGyroJerk-std()-Z"      
[31] "tBodyAccMag-mean()"          "tBodyAccMag-std()"          
[33] "tGravityAccMag-mean()"       "tGravityAccMag-std()"       
[35] "tBodyAccJerkMag-mean()"      "tBodyAccJerkMag-std()"      
[37] "tBodyGyroMag-mean()"         "tBodyGyroMag-std()"         
[39] "tBodyGyroJerkMag-mean()"     "tBodyGyroJerkMag-std()"     
[41] "fBodyAcc-mean()-X"           "fBodyAcc-mean()-Y"          
[43] "fBodyAcc-mean()-Z"           "fBodyAcc-std()-X"           
[45] "fBodyAcc-std()-Y"            "fBodyAcc-std()-Z"           
[47] "fBodyAccJerk-mean()-X"       "fBodyAccJerk-mean()-Y"      
[49] "fBodyAccJerk-mean()-Z"       "fBodyAccJerk-std()-X"       
[51] "fBodyAccJerk-std()-Y"        "fBodyAccJerk-std()-Z"       
[53] "fBodyGyro-mean()-X"          "fBodyGyro-mean()-Y"         
[55] "fBodyGyro-mean()-Z"          "fBodyGyro-std()-X"          
[57] "fBodyGyro-std()-Y"           "fBodyGyro-std()-Z"          
[59] "fBodyAccMag-mean()"          "fBodyAccMag-std()"          
[61] "fBodyBodyAccJerkMag-mean()"  "fBodyBodyAccJerkMag-std()"  
[63] "fBodyBodyGyroMag-mean()"     "fBodyBodyGyroMag-std()"     
[65] "fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag-mean()" "fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag-std()"
[67] "subject"                     "activity"

Here, we can see that the raw variable names don't respect the rules given in the last page of the video lecture "Editing Text Variables".
It says that names of variables should be:
- All lower case when possible
- Descriptive (Diagnosis versus Dx)
- Not duplicated
- Not have underscores or dots or white spaces

So I've done the following transformation to the variable names for respecting these rules:
- removed the dashes
- removed the parentheses
- when the first letter of the variable is "t", replaced it by "time"
- when the first letter of the variable is "f", replaced it by "freq" for signifying the freqency
- replaced the string "mean" by "Mean"
- and replaced the string "std" by the more descriptive "StandardDeviation"

I end up with the following variable names:
 [1] "timeBodyAccMeanX"                    "timeBodyAccMeanY"                        
 [3] "timeBodyAccMeanZ"                    "timeBodyAccStandardDeviationX"

[67] "subject"                                 
[68] "activity"

I've considered these variable names as descriptive enough.
Indeed, if I make them more descritive, I will end up with variable names too long. So that's why I've only done the transformations described above.

## 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
6. For each of the variables above, except for "subject" and "activity", I calculate the average (mean) grouping by subject and activity.

And I store the result in the data set called tidyData.
This is a data frame of 180 observations from 68 variables.
And this is the output, I write on a file called "tidyData.txt".
